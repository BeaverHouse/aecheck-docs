## Changes from old AE Check

#### Character Check UI
![img1]
In old website, Check UI is grouped by character.   
However, It use too much page spaces because of that.

Also, elements are added on character personality with recent patches, and WFS added characters that requires specific element, Sesta for example.   
I thought that it is essential to separate characters, because all character can differ w/ elements & personalities, even between same characters with another style.   
It is quite old-fashioned that group all Shadow / Crystal / Thunder elements to "Etc." category too.

So I separated all characters on new website, and added many filter options to find characters easily. Many utilities are updated too.

#### Deletion of Buddy Check, and New Check : Grasta
For now, you can get buddies in 2 ways : from game content, or encounter.   
I thought that it's unnecessary to double-check buddy in current situation, so I removed buddy check and provide buddy's info only.

Grasta check is added because many AE players are considering for that. Hope that it helps.

#### Update Personality Data
Old website's personality data is quite incomplete because I wrote data by hands.   

I wrote some code to migrate personality data from [Seesaa Wiki][ref1], so I think it becomes more accurate than old one.   
Other data verification will be added someday, if needed.

#### Link other info site
I linked [Seesaa Wiki][ref1] page by character, and [Altema][ref2] / [AE Wiki][ref3] for dungeon.

I selected Seesaa Wiki because it has many reasonable data, based on JP server.

#### New Analysis
Today AE has almost 200 characters, so It became harder to check info with old website's "My Result" page.    
So I added some UI on recommending Star Dream Encounter & Treatise/Codex/Opus, pre-filtering some useless options like free characters.   
Legacy UI will be continuously provided on new website too.

<br>

#### Other
- Old UI is deprecated.   
For example, there is **Table View** on old website.   
This functionality had been maintained from AE Check's first version, but I determined to delete it because there is so many dual-element characters for now, and It's more important to reveal exact element data than before.
- Many site utilities are added, like Dark Mode, or `.webp` support.
